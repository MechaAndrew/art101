		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p>I have taken coding classes before, so there was little challenge as I was coming in with background knowledge</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p>The only problems that arrose was when we mistyped words or read the wrong lines. I was also having issues getting my script to come on the website screem.
			Turns out I just forgot to put a "+" in a certain place
		</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p>Through Discord we were able to talk and help each other out, and the results are our Lab5 pages
		</p>


			<h2>Script Output</h2>

			<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab5.js"></script>
