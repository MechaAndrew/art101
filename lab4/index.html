		<h1> Lab 4 - Pseudocode and Problem Solving </h1>
		<h2> Task 1: doing laundry </h2>
		<ol type="1">
			<li> Read the labels of each item of clothing.</li>
			<li> Place items labeled as "handwash" or "wash separately" in a separate pile </li>
			<li> Sort the laundry by color; lights and darks </li>
			<li> Sort each pile again depending on fabric type. </li>
			<li> Pick which laundry detergent you plan on using </li>
			<li> Read the directions to determine how much detergent to use based on the load size </li>
			<li> Pick a water temperature and cycle </li>
			<li> Load clothing into washing machine </li>
			<li> Once the load has finised being washed, unload the washing machine</li>
			<li> Load the clothes into the dryer </li>
			<li> Add a dryer sheet to the dryer </li>
			<li> Run the dryer according to the load amount </li>
			<li> Once the load has finished drying, unload the dryer </li>
			<li> Fold/hang clothes accordingly </li>
			<li> Clean the dryer's lint filter </li>
		</ol>
		<h2> Task 2: Pseudocode Task </h2>
		<h3> HangMan </h3>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>Enter the amout of people playing (2+)</li>
			<li>The player sets the amount of mistakes they can make</li>
			<li>The computer randomly generates a word that is stored in a variable</li>
			<li>Print a blank line for each letter in the word to represent the word length</li>
			<li>The player types in either a letter or whole word</li>
			<li>If; that letter is in the picked word, then add a point to the number of successes</li>
			<li>Else; add a point to how many fails the user can do</li>
			<li>If; the number of</li>

				Print a blank line for each letter in the word to represent the word length
				The player types in either a letter or whole word
					If; that letter is in the picked word, then add a point to the number of successes
					Else; add a point to how many fails the user can do and draw the next body part of the hangman.
					Along with making the next player guess (if there is one)
						If; the number of fails is >= 9 the user has lost
						Display failure message
						Else if; the number of successes is >= length of word the player wins
						Display success message
				Repeat Process

			<h3> Challenge </h3>
			<p>At first we thought the pseudocoding part was going to be difficult, but it was very easy to get through</p>
			<h3> Problems </h3>
			<p>No problems</p>
			<h3> Results </h3>
			<p>Through using Teletype, we were able to jointly write our pseudocode without any major obstacles.
				It was a collaborative process.
				We were able to communicate clearly and contribute our ideas in a fair manner.
