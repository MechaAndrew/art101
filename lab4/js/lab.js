Enter the amount of people playing (2+)
The computer randomly generates a word that is stored in a variable
Print a blank line for each letter in the word to represent the word length
The player types in either a letter or whole word
  If; that letter is in the picked word, then add a point to the number of successes
  Else; add a point to how many fails the user can do and draw the next body part of the hangman. Along with making the next player guess (if there is one)
    If; the number of fails is >= 9 the user has lost
    Display failure message
    Else if; the number of successes is >= length of word the player wins
    Display success message
Repeat Process
