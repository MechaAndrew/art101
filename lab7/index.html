		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p>I have taken coding classes before, so there was little challenge as I was coming in with background knowledge</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p>The first assignmnet was easy to get through, but the X task was very problematic and got annoying
		</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p>While we tried our best on Task X, we souldn't fully figure it out. But what we resulted in was our completed Lab 7.
