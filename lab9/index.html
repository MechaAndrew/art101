		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p>There was a lot of challenge going into this assignmnet. This is relatively new territory for me.</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p>Despite following the prompt and following the examples in the notes, my code flopped. I even put it in the browser which worked fine. But in Atom it didn't work.
		</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p>What we resulted in was our Lab 9.
