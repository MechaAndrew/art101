		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p>There was a lot of challenge going into this assignmnet. This is relatively new territory for me.</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p>Despite following the prompt and following the examples in the notes, my code was flopping. I even put it in the browser which worked fine. But in Atom it didn't work.
			That is until in class where we were able to find the issue which was that I didn't use "defer".
		</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p>What we resulted in was our Lab 9.
