		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p id=challenge class="section">Gettign back into coding after not having a class made me feel little off and having to go back to the notes
			a couple of times. But overall not much of a challenge.</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p id=problem class="section">Fortunetly there wasn't many issues when going into this lab. There was a problem with .length
			only returning a "1", but in class we leared to use .val() which saved my code.
		</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p id=result class="section">What we resulted in was our Lab 12.
