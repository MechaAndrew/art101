		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p>I have taken coding classes before, so there was little challenge as I was coming in with background knowledge</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p>The only problems that arrose was when we mistyped words or read the wrong lines.
			When creating my objects I didn't know each line or seperate obeject had to be seperated with a comma and not a semicolon,
			but I figured out my issue quickly.
		</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p>Through Discord we were able to talk and help each other out, and the results are our Lab6 pages
		</p>
