		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p>There was a lot of challenge going into this assignmnet. This is relatively new territory for me.</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p>At first I didn't fully understand the assignment. Fortunetly my partner helped me explain it and shared the professor's test file so I can get some better footing.
			I wanted to do somethign a little different from the assignmnet, so instead of an input box I wanted to use the alert box once the button was pressed.
			This showed to be harder than I thought as my functions were acting before I wanted them to and saving the inputed name became difficult. Fortunetly I figured it out
			and even incorporated anagram into the statement.
		</p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p>What we resulted in was our Lab 10.
